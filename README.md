# ![Game Icon](./resources/icon_md.png) TicTacToe

This is a small project I am making to get better at GUI development and to also practise creating a 2-player game AI (by using theory of State Spaces and Scoring).

The GUI is powered by PyQt5, through which I hope to master callback mechanisms and event-driven app development.
